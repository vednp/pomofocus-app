# PomoFocus App


PomoFocus is a productivity application designed to help you manage your tasks and time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s that utilizes timed intervals (traditionally 25 minutes in length) to break work into manageable segments, separated by short breaks. PomoFocus aims to enhance your productivity and focus by providing a clean and intuitive interface to organize your tasks and track your work sessions.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Set a timer for your work sessions and breaks, following the Pomodoro Technique.
- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks to organize your to-do list effectively.
- **Task Categories**: Categorize your tasks to prioritize and focus on specific areas of work.
- **Statistics**: Track your productivity with detailed statistics, including the number of completed Pomodoros and tasks.
- **Customization**: Personalize your experience by choosing from a range of themes and sounds.
